# Virtual-Warp
The implement algorithm cc by two kind of virtual warp. (cc:connected component)


src: the preprocessing of graph ,eg.reading graph file and partitioning graph.
data: changing the structure of input graph data. The structure of input file should be edge list ,and the structure of output file is CSR.(Compressed Sparse Row)
